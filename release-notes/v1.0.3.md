# v1.0.3 — 2025-08-29

Feature updates across calendar/date UX, media, auth redirects, public viewing, and image delivery; plus refactors and fixes.

## Added
- Unified pop‑up calendar with story highlights; dedicated calendar API.
- Date search on manage page; show story date in manage page.
- Support for story videos; images resource; app manifest.
- Reader and editor roles.

## Changed
- Manage page uses local timezone; retrieval aligned to Eastern time.
- Edit page uses the new calendar popover to match submit flow.
- Serve images from internal path; add long‑term cache headers for images.
- Public viewing feature (configurable via `PUBLIC_VIEW`); filter future stories from default view.
- Calendar query updated to use index for performance.
- Email search is case‑insensitive; simplify allowed accounts counting and store accounts in DB; add index to allowed_accounts.
- Split worker into modules (internal refactor).

## Fixed
- OAuth: corrected `OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`; centralize redirect handling.
- UI fixes: search icon alignment, manage page date/timezone display, repeated declaration, and video file update handling.
- Hide story image until fully loaded to prevent layout shift.

## Docs
- Add and update `AGENTS.md` guidance for contributors/agents.
